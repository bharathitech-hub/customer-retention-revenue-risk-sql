## Executive Summary

This analysis focuses on identifying revenue concentration risks, early churn signals, and customer prioritization opportunities using transactional and behavioral data. The insights aim to support data-driven decisions for revenue stability, customer retention, and operational improvements.




### Revenue Concentration Risk
A small percentage of customers contribute a disproportionately large share of total revenue. This indicates dependency on a limited customer base, increasing financial risk if these customers churn.




### Early Churn Warning Signals
Customers with long inactivity periods, repeated support interactions, and high payment failure rates show strong indicators of churn risk. These patterns can be detected before actual churn occurs.




### Customer Segmentation Opportunities
Customers can be clearly segmented into high, medium, and low value groups based on revenue and engagement. High-value customers require retention focus, while medium-value customers present upsell potential.





### Payment Failure Impact
A noticeable portion of customers experience repeated payment failures, which correlates with reduced transaction frequency and potential revenue loss.




### Cohort Retention Trends
Customer cohorts show declining engagement over time, with significant drop-offs after the initial months. This highlights the importance of stronger onboarding and early engagement strategies.




## Business Recommendations

- Prioritize retention strategies for high-revenue customers to reduce concentration risk.
- Implement early churn intervention programs for customers showing inactivity and support escalation.
- Improve payment infrastructure and retry mechanisms to reduce failed transactions.
- Design targeted engagement strategies for different customer segments.
